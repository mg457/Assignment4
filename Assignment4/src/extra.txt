A priority queue was used to keep track of distances in k-NN. 
	- A priority queue has O(n) insertion [must find proper queue location],
	and O(1) access [popping off front of the queue].
	- Sorting algorithms are generally O(n log n) [Collections.sort has this];
	would also be constant access off one end of the structure.
